**Testing Spark Streaming functionality.**

We are planning to cover `DStream` transformations, integration with streaming sources such as `Kafka`,
`Flume` and `Kinesis`, and possibly integration with `Akka Streams`.

For high-level concepts, functionality, API and more, see the official documentation at
https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/streaming-programming-guide.html.
